##### Terminologies
```
Primary key is a unique key value and should anot occur twicw in the table - (Eg. Column)

Foreign key links two tables together.

Compound key consists of multiple columns.

Index in a database is like an index in back of book.

Redundancy is the phenomena or idea of storing of data twice.

##### Log into mysql

```
mysql -u root -p

mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p     //For writing and reading file permissions

Then type your mysql password
```
-----
##### Show databases using command line
```mysql
SHOW DATABASES/databases;
```
##### Change database 
```mysql
USE <database_name>
```
##### Show tables 
```mysql
SHOW TABLES/tables;
```
##### Showing table structure
```mysql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM <table_name>;
DESCRIBE <table_name>;
```
##### Create Database
```mysql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>
```
##### Delete Databases
```mysql
DROP DATABASE <database_name>
```

##### Delete table
```mysql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

##### Use Database
```mysql
USE <database_name>

We must use this command before creating a new table in a database
```
##### Creating a Table
```mysql
CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
column_name(feature_name) data_type if_must_be_filled(NULL or NOT NULL) AUTO_INCREMENT(For IDs) DEFAULT default_value,
PRIMARY_KEY(id_var)
);

CREATE TABLE teams_db (
team_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT FIRST,
team_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL AFTER team_id,
PRIMARY_KEY(team_id)
);
```
##### Inserting data into a table
```mysql
INSERT INTO <table_name> (
var_name1, var_nam2, var_nam3)
VALUES(data1, data2, data3);

The string can be inserted using ' ' or " ". doesnot matter.

INSERT INTO team_tbl (
team_name, team_captain, establishment_data)
VALUES('Dronacharya', "Swain Shrestha", NOW()/'2017-12-04');
```

##### See all values of the table
```mysql
SELECT * FROM <table_name>;    // * is a WildCard

```
##### Select specific non repeating data from a table
```mysql 
SELECT DISTINCT var_name FROM table_name;
```
##### select limited rows
```mysql
SELECT var_name FROM table_name LIMIT number;
```
##### Select specific data from a table
```mysql
SELECT var_name FROM <table_name> [WHERE condition that the data must satisfy];

SELECT table_name.var_name FROM table_name;  //using fully qualified names

SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_captain="Swain Shrestha";

Upper case and lower case do not matter by default.
```

##### Select specific data using BETWEEN
```mysql
SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_id BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
```

##### Select specific data using IN
```mysql
SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_captain IN/NOT IN ('Swain','Sushil','Sajan','Shovan', 'Nischal');
```

##### Select using Wildcards
```
SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_captain LIKE 'comp%';

SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_captain LIKE '%comp%';

SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE team_captain LIKE 'h%d'; //anything starting with h and ending with d
```

##### Comparision Operators
```
> < >= <= !=(<>) =
```

##### Logical Operators
```mysql
AND OR NOT
```

##### Comparion for Special character like NULL
```mysql
IS

SELECT team_name FROM team_tbl WHERE tteam_captain IS NULL;
```

##### Extract year from Date
```mysql
YEAR(NOW());    YEAR(2052-03-10);
```

##### Ordering the table elements
```mysql
SELECT * FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <var_name1>,<var_name2> ASC/DESC LIMIT <no_of_elements_t display>;

SELECT * FROM team_tbl ORDER BY establishment_date ASC LIMIT 1;  //finding lowest or highest
```
##### Using GROUP BY
```mysql
if the table consists of two captains with the same name but with different team names the GROUP BY will show only one person's name.

SELECT * FROM <table_name> GROUP_BY <var_name> ORDER BY <var_name2> ASC;

SELECT * FROM team_tbl GROUP BY team_captain ORDER BY team_name ASC;
```
##### Quering multiple tables
```mysql
SELECT var_name1, var_name2 FROM table1, table2 WHERE table1.var_name3 = table1.var_name3;

SELECT team_name, team_captain, result FROM team_tbl, result_tbl WHERE 
team_tbl.team_id = result_tbl.team_id;
```

##### Deleting everything from the table
```mysql
DELETE FROM <table_name>;
```

##### Deleting with condition
```mysql
DELETE FROM <table_name> where var_name = something;

DELETE FROM team_tbl WHERE team_id = 5;
```
##### Update table
```mysql
UPDATE <table_name> SET field1 = new_value1, field2 = new_value2 [WHERE];

UPDATE team_tbl SET team_captain = "John Subba" WHERE team_name = "Bulls";
```
##### using incomplete variable name to select
```mysql
SELECT var_name1, var_name2 WHERE var_name3 LIKE 'valu%';

SELECT team_id, team_name WHERE team_captain LIKE 'Swa%';
```
##### Using Regex
```mysql
^       matches beginning of the string.
$       matches pattern at the end of the string.
.       Any single character
[...]   Any character listd between the square brackets.
[^]     Any character not listed between the square brackets.
p1|p2|p3  Matches any pattern p1, p2, p3
*       zero or more instances of preceding element
+       one or more instances of preceding element
{n}     n instances of preceding element
{m, n}  m through n instances of preceding element
```
```
SELECT var_name1 FROM table_name WHERE REGEXP '^L';

SELECT var_name FROM table_name WHERE REGEXP '[1-5] boxes of frogs';
```

##### Alter table
```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP var_name

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD var_name2 INT NOT NULL AFTER var_name1;

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD var_name DATE NOT NULL FIRST; 

ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY var_name VARCHAR(10);

ALTER TABLE table_name1 RENAME TO table_name2;

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (column_list);

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE index_name (column_list);

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD INDEX index_name (column_list);
```

##### Creating index
```mysql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
```

##### Temporary Table
```mysql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ...;
The table wont be shown using SHOW TABLES and it will vanish after logging out the session.
```

##### Tackling secure file privileges
```mysql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";

and using the same path for the file.
```

##### Write data from table to file and load data from file to table
```mysql
SELECT * FROM table_name INTO OUTFILE 'var/lib/mysql-files/file_name.txt' FIELDS TERMINATED By ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'  LINES TERMINATED BY '\n\r';

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'var/lib/mysql-files/file_name.txt' INTO TABLE table_name FIELDS TERMINATED By ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'  LINES TERMINATED BY '\r';
```
##### Dump database or table to a file or from file to a database
```mysql
mysqldump -u root -p db_name table_name > ~/Desktop/table_name_dump.txt

mysqldump -u root -p db_name table_name < ~/Desktop/table_name_dump.txt

mysqldump -u root -p db_name < ~/Desktop/db_name_dump.txt
```
##### MYSQLIMPORT
```mysql
mysqlimport -u root -p --local db_name ~/pathname/file_name.txt

mysqlimport -u root -p --local --fields-terminated-by="," --line-terminated-by="\r\n" db_name ~/pathname/file_name.txt
```

##### Import using LOAD DATA
```mysql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '~/pathname/file_name.txt' INTO TABLE table_name;
```

##### Starting lampp server
```
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
```

##### Stopping lampp server
```
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp stop
```
##### Using terminal for apache server
```
Start apache command: $ sudo systemctl start apache2.service.
stop apache command : $ sudo systemctl stop apache2.service.
restart apache command: $ sudo systemctl restart apache2.service.
apache2ctl command can be used to stop or start apache web server under any Linux distribution or UNIX
```
##### Creating custom column
```mysql
SELECT CONCAT(var_name1, ',', var_name2) AS new_var_name FROM table_name;
```

##### Using Functions
```
SELECT name, UPPER(name) FROM table_name;

SELECT cost, SQRT(cost) FROM table_name;  

###### Aggregate function

SELECT AVG(cost), SUM(cost) FROM table_name; 

SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, SUM(cost) AS sum, MAX(cost) AS max FROM table_name WHERE team_id=1;
```

##### Using HAVING
```mysql
SELECT seller_id, COUNT(*) AS count FROM table_name GROUP BY seller_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;

HAVING is used when we use GROUPs and WHERE is used when we want rows.

```
##### Using Sub-Query
```
SELECT name, cost FROM table_name WHERE cost >= (
  SELECT AVG(cost) FROM table_name
)
ORDER BY cost DESC;
```

##### Using JOIN
```
//LEFT JOIN means the left table is included no matter what,forces left table tp be shown.

SELECT customer.name, items.name FROM customer LEFT OUTER JOIN  
items ON customer.id = seller_id;
```

##### Using UNION
```
SELECT name, cost, bids FROM table_name  WHERE bids > 100
UNION
SELECT name , cost, bids FROM table_name WHERE cost < 1000 ;

The column names must be the same in both the queries.

UNION ALL - leaves duplicate entries
```

##### Insert into multiple rows
```
INSERT INTO table_name(var1, var2, var3) VALUES
(p1,q1, r1),
(p2, q2, r2);

INSERT INTO table_name(var1, var2, var3) SELECT

```

##### Rename table
```mysql
RENAME TABLE table_name1 TO table_name2;
```

##### Using view
```mysql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT * FROM table_name;

View is a dynamic table for viewing purpose which gets updated whenever the original table gets updated.
```
##### ACID
```
Atomicity - All parts of a transaction succeed or fail together.

Consistency - The database will always be consistent.

Isolation - No transaction can interfere with another's. Isolation brings us the benefit of hiding uncommitted state changes from the outside world, as failing transactions shouldnâ€™t ever corrupt the state of the system.

Durability - Once the transaction is committed it wont be lost. A successful transaction must permanently change the state of a system
```
